clean-up-contracts-data
=======================

Challenge task for internship at YIPL.

I have used JavaScript for merging the given CSV files.
I haven't used any JavaScript libraries other than jQuery for accessing,parsing and exporting the csv files.
I have used regular expression and splitting for parsing the CSV files into arrays and perform required operations.

Note:Google Chrome requires localhost to access the CSV files while Firefox doesn't.
otherwise you can set the --allow-file-access-from-files flag for Chrome for it to run in Chrome browser.
